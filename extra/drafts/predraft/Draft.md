## Abstract

The increasing complexity of Linux systems, coupled with the growing demand for automation in software development and system management, necessitates innovative solutions [15, 16]. This research explores the feasibility of employing a Large Language Model [11, 13], specifically LLaMa v2, to create a cost-effective Virtual Assistant [7, 8, 10, 11, 13] tailored for Arch Linux users. The aim is to enhance user experience by providing context-specific suggestions and addressing general queries related to the installed software.

## Introduction

[comment]: <> (Expandir la cosas )

As the landscape of Linux systems evolves, the intricate nature of these platforms poses challenges for users, particularly in terms of system management and software development. The versatility and continuous evolution of GNU/Linux, in alignment with its open-source philosophy, contribute to a dynamic environment marked by diverse distributions and frequent updates [15, 16, 18]. In this context, the demand for effective automation tools becomes essential to streamline tasks and improve user productivity [17, 18].

Nowadays, virtual assistants are becoming into a essential tool for users, handling with their shoppings, traveling, wheatear querying, etc... Projects and products like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri leave GNU/Linux without any native support, even if GNU/Linux community has projects like Deeping Assistant (Which is still on development) or KDE Connect which provide similar features, the reality of this is that state of the art for virtual assistant is focus on AGI [<TODO: buscar la cita del estado del arte de los VA>] but, there's no enough research on GNU/Linux systems, specially on systems Rolling Release like Arch Linux. Due to its continues updating process, this way exploring this subset of systems becomes something interesting, it owns exceptional characteristics that Virtual Assistant are not prepare for, that's why using some extra features become crucial, those features can be provided by autonomous agents to achieve a continues loop of context for the virtual assistant.

Recognizing the need for innovative solutions in this complex Linux ecosystem, this research delves into the potential of leveraging advanced technologies to address the challenges faced by Arch Linux users [15]. With a focus on system management and software-related queries, the study seeks to explore the feasibility of employing a Large Language Model (LLM) known as LLaMa v2 [11, 13]. LLM have been taken as the closes approach to Autonomous Agents as a consequence of LLMs are characterized by their natural language processing capabilities, offer a promising path to creating intelligent and cost-effective virtual assistants [7, 8, 10, 11, 13].

### Problem context

[comment]: <> (Dejar esto)

The challenges inherent in managing Arch  Linux systems are amplified by the system's rolling release model, introducing potential stability issues [15]. Moreover, the unique philosophy of GNU/Linux, where information is distributed across a multitude of sources without a centralized repository, presents a formidable challenge for developers seeking to generalize information for broader use [15, 16, 18]. The dynamism of GNU/Linux distributions, with new ones emerging and others becoming obsolete in short periods, further complicates the process of collecting and maintaining up-to-date data [17, 18].

Recognizing these complexities, this research seeks to navigate the intricate Linux landscape by proposing a Virtual Assistant tailored for Arch Linux users [15]. The Virtual Assistant aims to empower users with context-specific suggestions and solutions to general queries about their installed software, thereby improving the overall user experience [15, 16, 18].

While Virtual Assistants have become increasingly common [1-5], their adaptation to the nuances of the Linux environment, especially tailored for specific distributions like Arch Linux, remains an underexplored domain. The potential benefits of employing LLaMa v2 as the backbone for such a Virtual Assistant further motivate this investigation, with the goal of contributing to the efficiency and user-friendliness of Linux system management and software-related tasks [14].

By addressing the unique challenges presented by Arch Linux and the broader GNU/Linux ecosystem, this research aspires to pave the way for the development of intelligent and adaptive Virtual Assistants, fostering a more seamless integration of automation in the Linux user experience [6].

## Justification

GNU/Linux philosophy have been developed under the Open culture, this characteristic aims to provide users the option to learn, share, fix or talk about solutions to any problem or issue with a dependency, an specific task and so on ([Ask about this](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)). This approach creates a continue workflow of options for users to solve their problems with their systems or their particular tasks. In principle, that workflow provide a huge amount of solutions, for a great diversity of problems; but that approach have created some particularities had made of GNU/Linux environment a difficult one for new users and experimented users, [if you check sites like SourceForge you will quickly realize that - Find a better ref].

It is well known on GNU/Linux community that you can install at least two different packages for anything you need to do, which is a good example of the choosing paradox ([Get some philologist here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice)), in which you don't know what to choose due to the amount of options each with pros and cons inherent to their context (Find a ref about this), this is the reason it is so common on GNU/Linux community to write large wikis with a set of different solutions. Arch Linux wiki or Ubuntu Forum are two example of those centric sites to look for solutions, information or options. In short, they are well documented and organized, indeed it is so common for new users to have the necessity of keep looking for hours a solution, a system could provide with a short sente, a command or a package, what is the most common solutions users are looking for. In the other hand, when experimented users have a problem those problems generally are related to package's state, a miss configurations of two or more tools or simple the necessity to install an specific package, so the cycle starts again for them, having the necessity to look for solutions reading for hours.

The proposal is to use a Virtual assistant (VA) directly installed on each user machine getting the context from user's OS giving context to a cost-efficient pre-trained LLM based on Llama v2 to improve accuracy of given solutions, directly having the systems context reading OS characteristic from man and help command outputs, differing with options like ChatGPT, Gemini or similar GTPs models that need to have context to be provided as a prompt that depends on user previous knowledge of the problem

## General objective

Design a virtual assistant proposal that uses Llama v2 to extend the base functionalities of a virtual assistant to be able to give an Arch Linux user insights about their system, help them managing their operative systems, providing context-specific suggestions, and addressing general software-related inquiries

### Specific objectives

- Adapt Llama v2 to create a cost-efficient LLM available to be used in GNU/Linux systems under the context of a virtual assistant

- Extend the features of a virtual assistant to support a pre

- Evaluate the system performance
